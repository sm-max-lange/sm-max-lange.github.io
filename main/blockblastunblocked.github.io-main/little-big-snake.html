						<p>Additionally, the game includes a dynamic map where players must not only focus on their growth but also be wary of larger snakes and environmental hazards.

									<li style="list-style-type: disc">Control Your Snake: Use your mouse or touch controls to guide your snake around the map. Your objective is to consume glowing orbs to grow larger while avoiding other snakes. Use the left mouse button or tap to speed up, but be mindful that this action reduces your size.</li>
									<li style="list-style-type: disc">Eat and Grow: As you consume orbs and small creatures, your snake will grow in size. The larger your snake becomes, the more you can block and trap smaller opponents. Be careful to avoid running into other snakes, as this will result in your defeat.</li>
